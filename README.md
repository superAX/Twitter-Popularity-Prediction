# Twitter-Popularity-Prediction

The goal of this project was to analyze the tweet activity for given hashtags from Twitter in order to predict its future popularity. We train a regression model with the given data, and use it to make predictions for other hashtags. The dataset that we are using was obtained by querying popular Twitter hashtags related to the 2015 Super Bowl spanning a period starting from 2 weeks before the game to a week after the game.
